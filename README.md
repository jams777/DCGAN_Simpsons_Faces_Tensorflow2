# DCGAN_Simpsons_Faces_Tensorflow2
DCGAN Simpsons Faces Image Generator usging Tensorflow2 Alpha üñºÔ∏è.

# Reimplemented Image Generator as Tensorflow2
 
Reimplemented [Greg](https://github.com/gsurma)'s image generator as tensorflow2-alpha. <br>
[Greg](https://github.com/gsurma)'s image generator can be found [here](https://github.com/gsurma/image_generator). <br>
The reimplementation used [Greg](https://github.com/gsurma)'s hyperparameters and datasets. <br>

# Simpsons Faces Image Generator

Python notebook containing TensorFlow2 DCGAN implementation. 
The data was downloaded as described by Greg. 
It was trained on a [Simpsons Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/kostastokis/simpsons-faces) dataset.

<br>

I applied the list of image files that [Greg](https://github.com/gsurma) excluded. ( simpsons_dataset.txt )

<br>

Check out corresponding Kaggle kernel: [Image Generator](https://www.kaggle.com/greg115/image-generator-dcgan-the-simpsons-dataset).
